For these rare situations, Terraform has special handling of any configuration file whose name ends in _override.tf or _override.tf.json. This special handling also applies to a file named literally override.tf or override.tf.json.


$ terraform init


$ terraform plan


Expected Result:


resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami           = "foo"
}
